    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Design26 Foundation started in March 2018.  This is a Social Business Enterprise aim to reduce poverty through providing sewing skills training, counselling and job opportunities to vulnerable teenage mothers and disadvantaged girls of Mitchells Plain and its surrounding areas.</p>
    <p>Design26 Foundation was formed in collaboration with Design26 (Pty) Ltd after Suraya Williams dealt with teenage girls providing them with a service and then saw them being effected by pregnancies and the drastic effect it had.</p>
